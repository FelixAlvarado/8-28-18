What is the floyd-warchall algorithm good for and how does it work? 

it finds the shortest distances between every pair of vetices given edge weighted direct graph. 
1. initialize matric by filling in based on neighboring vertices for each vertex 
2. After initial fill out, there is possible cases for unfilled vetices 
a) k is not an imediate vertex in shortest path from i to j, need the value of dist[i][j] as it is 
b) k is in the shortest path: update dist[i][j] = dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]

What is the idea of creating services? 

It helps makes controller "skinnier" and easier to maintain 

What is a bloom filter?

What is a singleton?

What are containers (OOP Design)?

What is Pub-sub pattern?

Messaging pattern where senders (publishers) do not publish messages to be sent directly to specific receivers (subscribers) but instead catergorize published messages into classes without knowledge of which subscribers there may be subscribers express interest in one or more classes and only reeive messages that are of interest, without knowledge of the publisher of that message.
