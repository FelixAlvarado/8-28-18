What is the floyd-warchall algorithm good for and how does it work? 

it finds the shortest distances between every pair of vetices given edge weighted direct graph. 
1. initialize matric by filling in based on neighboring vertices for each vertex 
2. After initial fill out, there is possible cases for unfilled vetices 
a) k is not an imediate vertex in shortest path from i to j, need the value of dist[i][j] as it is 
b) k is in the shortest path: update dist[i][j] = dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]
